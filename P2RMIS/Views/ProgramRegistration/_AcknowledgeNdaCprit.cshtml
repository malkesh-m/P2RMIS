                applicant for the CPRIT funding award or by SRA International, Inc., a CSRA Company, or both.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Committee Member is able to view such information for the sole purpose of the evaluation of

            <p>
                Committee Member acknowledges and agrees that a breach of this Agreement by Committee
                Member would cause CPRIT, a grant applicant, or CSRA to suffer irreparable damage that could not

                the grant applicant, and/or CSRA, shall have the right to seek and obtain immediate injunctive relief
                from the breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. Such relief includes specific performance
                of the obligations provided herein to enjoin the breach or further breach of this Agreement, in
                addition to all other rights and remedies available at law, in equity, or otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
                If any of the rights or restrictions contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to be unenforceable
                by reason of the extent, duration or geographic scope, or other provision hereof, then the Committee
                Member hereto agrees that the court shall reduce such extent, duration, geographic scope or other
                provision hereof and enforce the provisions in reduced form for all purposes in the manner
                contemplated hereby.
