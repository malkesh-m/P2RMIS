' 1.0 Documentation
'
' Read the following in order to familiarize yourself with the sample script.
' 

' 1.1 Overview
'
' This sample script uses a script file (.rss) and the script environment to run 
' Web service operations on a specified report server. The script creates a folder 
' that you specify as a command-prompt variable using the –v switch, and then 
' publishes the sample reports that ship with Reporting Services to a report server.
' Depending on the location of your sample reports, you may need to modify the 
' value of the filePath variable, which references the path to your sample reports.
' 
' 1.2 Script Variables
'
' Variables that are passed on the command line with the -v switch:
'
' (a) parentFolder - corresponds to the folder that the script creates and uses 
'     to contain your published reports
'
' 1.3 Sample Command Lines
' 
' 
' 1.3.1 Use the script to publish the sample reports to an AdventureWorks Sample Reports folder.
' 
'       rs -i PublishSampleReports.rss -s http://myserver/reportserver
'
